# To-do-list-with-deadline
You can use this to-do-list to drop down what to do with a dedicated deadline assigned.
Complete the tasks if you have finished the tasks, and you will have a record of your completed tasks.
Remove the tasks from the list if you want to delete it.
You will have the record of your to-do-list next time you open the list.
